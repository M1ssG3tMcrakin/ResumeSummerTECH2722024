	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Origin: She once played pitch-matching games with my sister. She got diagnosed with High-functioning autism at the age of 3, with speech delay, but after listening to disney scores and swimming in luxurious waters, she learned how to speak properly. Then, she started being homeschooled, when she was in first grade, after an autistic program in a wonderful elementary school failed to support her. Ever since, she has explored numerous amounts of music including with xylophones, guitars, pianos, voice, saxophones, a music-composing program and oboes. The alto saxophone is one of her favorite instruments, to this day. After a certain amount of experience with the alto saxophone and composing music, her private music teacher reccomended taking Music Theory college courses at the age of 13, which has developed her music skills tree, greatly. And, that's how she became a mostly hardworking, intelligent, gifted, dual-enrolled college student at this glorious college.</li>
	<li>Having aced all of her music theory courses, performed college &amp; highschool music, &amp; started composing music and thinking about her future in developing breathtaking video games, media, movies, light-hearted, action-packed drama and cartoons, Ariel Edgell, at the age of 16 going on 17, pursues her next major in Computer Sciences and Simulation from developing her favorite number wizard &amp; hidden objects game to creating a fabulous resume to producing a few 3d animated projects and films.</li>
